            <li>Canned Tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 ½ quarts whole milk</li>
            <li> ½ cup raisins or sultanas</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar

        <h4>Steps:</h4>

        <ol type="i">
            <li><b>Step 1 :</b> Heat ghee in a large saucepan over medium heat and add carrots. Cook and stir briefly, about 3 minutes. Pour in milk and increase heat; bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer gently, uncovered, and stirring occasionally until moisture evaporates, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li> <b> Step 2 : </b>Bring carrot mixture back to a boil; add sugar, raisins, cardamom, and saffron. Cook and stir until mixture has thickened, about 10 minutes.

            </li>
            <li><b>Step 3 : </b>Ladle carrot halwa into 8 individual serving dishes. Top each serving with 1 tablespoon pistachios. Serve warm or chill before serving.</li>
            <!-- <li><b>Bake the lasagna: </b>Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li> -->
