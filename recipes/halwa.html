    <h3>Description</h3> 
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade <strong>lasagna</strong> recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd <em>cottage cheese and Parmesan</em>. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty <i>garlic bread</i>.</p>
    <p>Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems. Don't be intimidated by all the layers of delicious Italian flavor â€” try this homemade lasagna recipe <b>today!</b></p>
